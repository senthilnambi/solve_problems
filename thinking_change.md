# Things that changed my way of thinking

There are at least three types of experiences. Those which:
  1. Completely change your way of thinking and acting
  2. Incrementally change
  3. Does nothing

Here are list of the first category:

1. Richard Feynman
  1. Do not take yourself too seriously.
  1. Life is best lived whimsically.
  1. Be infinitely curious about your surroundings.
  1. Do not rely on 'experts' for anything.
1. "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius
  1. Things only affect you if you let them.
  1. You should live a life that you think is moral, even if no one else was living it.
  1. People will rationalize their actions as they fit and change those rationalizations also. Do not act so superior, you probably do it as well.
1. "Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand
  1. For most people it is a bible for laissez-faire capitalism and objectivism, for me its the idea of pursuing something without letting things like ego and insecurity get in the way.
  1. Most popular things are almost outdated and specifically catered to appeal to the masses, so avoid them.
  1. Having the courage to pursue unpopular/unknown paths is second best to only working as hard till you drop dead.
1. "It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be" by Paul Arden
  1. Strive for you utmost best.
  1. Never let anyone else judge your capabilities or your potential.
  1. Make it your goal to work for the best in your industry.
1. "Rails" & "Ruby"
  1. Helped me to start creating things, rather than just producing them.
  1. Modularity is awesome.
1. "The Well Grounded Rubyist" by Manning & Ruby
  1. Helped me shed the shackles of Rails and learn about Ruby in its original sense.
1. "SOLID" & "Less: Path to better design" by Sandi Metz
  1. Writing programs is easy once you learn the syntax, maintaining them is much harder.
  1. Everything you write should work today and be able to evolve in face of change and increasing complexity.
  1. There is an entire OOP world outside Ruby.
1. "PeepCode play by play screencasts" & "mac + ipad + zsh + jumpstart + vim + pry"
  1. Tools are only means to solving problems and the best tools are that which does its job well and gets out of your way.
  1. Listen to pain and customize your tools to avoid them, but be wary of too much customization.
  1. Rails is just Ruby. Do not stay inside `models/` and create only monolithic ActiveRecord classes.
1. "You and your research" by Richard Hamming
  1. Have a list of the biggest problems in your field. Be open to opportunities that might help solve them.
  1. You must do great research or move over to let others. No one wants to be just a chair filler.
  1. Allocate time every week to contemplate the big problems in your field.
  1. Pick your battles. Do not try to change the system, except the parts that you really want to be changed.
1. Buckminister Fuller
  1. Live a live dedicated to solving problems, especially ones that plague you and others.
1. "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus
  1. Suicide is the only important philosophical question.
  1. We all want to find meaning in our lives, while universe is inherently cold to such questions.
1. "Man's search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl
  1. Meaning of life is not as important as realizing you are the one that is being asked the question.
  1. No one all comprising meaning to life, rather local to each person, also varies from time to time.
  1. There are only two types of people: decent and not. Every other division is meaningless.

Learned/deduced from own experiences:

1. Wanting to control something not in your control is the root of all misery.
1. Live is lived best when you strive for things you can control, rather than fruits of those actions.
  1. Goals, actions, reactions etc. are few things that you control. Almost everything else is beyond you.
1. You can never get anyone to change by telling/ordering/pleading. Can only hopeful to inspire after long periods of continuous action. That too is not certain.
1. Out of sight, out of mind. If you want to remember something, put it in front of your face. Beware of overflowing!
1. Change habits by making new habit more accessible and/or old habit costly. If you want to drink more water, get a bigger cup and/or keep water source nearby.
1. Solve problems. Big, small, does not matter. It is the only way you can make an impression on this planet.
1. Listen to pain and let it guide your action. There are two types of pain: good and bad.
  1. Good is when you do not want to do another push up, this you should do.
  1. Bad is when you want to destroy the world when a tool does not work to your specification, change your tool or the problem.
1. When faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem, step back. Try to change your approach or reframe the problem.
1. Mediocre/average life should be feared than most things in life.
1. The more you tell people how to live, the less they will care. Live as best as you can and let others learn if they want.
1. Most actions can be categorized under: creation or consumption.
  1. Creation is always preferred to consumption, even if what you create is infinitely worse than what others have created. The solution is to get better, not stop creating.
