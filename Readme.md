# Solve Problems

Following are a list of problems that I've encountered, my thoughts about them and solutions, if any, to solving them.

This is inspired by Buckminster Fuller's "experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity." [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#Bankruptcy_and_depression)

## Meta

### Problem

An outlet to showcase my thoughts. Need something more organized than a blog (categorically, not chronologically), visually appealling and editable with my favorite editor (vim).

### Solution

A markdown formatted Readme, viewed with [DocumentUp](http://documentup.com/#hosted), hosted with Github Pages.

### Alternatives
 * Jekyll + Twitter Bootstrap - Didn't want to spend time learning those tech.
 * Posterous/Tumblr - Not organized categorically by default.
