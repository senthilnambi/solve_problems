# Solve Problems

Following are a list of problems that I've encountered, my thoughts about them and solutions, if any, to solving them.

This is inspired by Buckminster Fuller's "experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity." [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#Bankruptcy_and_depression)

## Meta

### Problem

An outlet to showcase my thoughts. Need something more organized than a blog (categorically, not chronologically), visually appealling and editable with my favorite editor (vim).

My biggest problem with contemporary blogs are their 'fire and forget' nature. Recently written posts get all the attention, while earlier ones live a sad, lonely life under some rock.

### Solution

A markdown formatted Readme, viewed with [DocumentUp](http://documentup.com/#hosted), hosted with Github Pages.

### Thoughts

* [Timeless](http://timelessrepo.com/timeless) is another approach to solving the same problem.
* This approach will be problematic as the problems grow in size and complexity.
* Also when solution is not easily dedutable and takes trial and error process.

### Alternatives
 * Jekyll + Twitter Bootstrap - Didn't want to spend time learning those tech.
 * Posterous/Tumblr - Not organized categorically by default.
